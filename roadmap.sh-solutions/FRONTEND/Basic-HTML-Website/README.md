# Basic-HTML-Website 
### This project involves creating a simple website using only HTML with multiple pages.  

---

## Project Description  

In this project, I built a website with the following pages:  
- **Home**  
- **Projects**  
- **Articles**  
- **Contact**  

The website features a **navigation bar** present on all pages, allowing seamless navigation between them.  

### Goals of the Project  
- Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.  
- Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.  
- Organize the structure to easily add styles later.  
- Include basic SEO meta tags in the website.
