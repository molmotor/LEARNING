# Single Page CV Project  
### This is my first project where I created a single-page CV using only HTML.

## How to Run the Project  

1. **Download or clone** this repository to your local machine:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/molmotor-learnz/roadmap.sh-solutions/tree/main/Single-Page-CV
    ```  

2. **Open the project folder.**  

3. Locate the `index.html` file.  

4. **Open the file** in any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.) by double-clicking on it.  

That's it! The CV should now display in your browser.
