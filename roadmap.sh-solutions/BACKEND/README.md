## About  

This repository contains my journey through learning web development. Each project is designed to improve my skills in:  
- Writing clean and semantic HTML.  
- Structuring web pages and websites effectively.  
- Creating scalable and maintainable front-end projects.  

This repository is inspired by the [Backend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend).
